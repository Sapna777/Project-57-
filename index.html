    <h3> Coding</h3>

    <p>My SECOND most hobby is all about to do coding in laptops and PCs.Coding is a skill where you take instructions (the steps in a task) and translate it into a language the computer understands since computers do not communicate like humans. They communicate in a language called BINARY and it is uses 0's and 1's. Coders write the instructions using a programming language.I learn coding from my teacher Vaishnavi Bhagtani Mam . She is an amazing teacher from WhiteHat Jr. Coding is second most interesting part of my life.  </p>
